When Excalibar helped me in learning new techniques and enhance communication skills, Encoder was there for all my mates to support the competitive environment. When we were worried about our future, Guest Lectures by renowned personalities gave us a path to our goals. It is a great way to start your journey in the world of technology"

This tech fest had everything from gaming events to a full-fledged Hackathon. As a fresher in college and a newly joined member of Technobyte, I had a blast as I helped around in the fest. I learned a lot from my seniors who are super friendly and talented as well. I can't wait for this year's fest. It will be epic as usual :)"
